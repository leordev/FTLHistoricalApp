# Installation

Please don't judge the code because it was a very rush coding sesson (5 hours) and we could develop roughly the most part of our end product.

1. Install Node and NPM in your machine (please check http://nodejs.org)
1. Run the command `npm install react-native -g`
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/leordev/FTLHistoricalApp.git`
1. Go to the repository folder and run the command: `npm install`
1. Finally run the app through iOS simulator: `react-native run-ios`

Obs: If you are in a Windows machine and want to run the Android emulator, please check 
[this instructions](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/react-native-maps/blob/master/docs/installation.md) 
to add the Google Maps API to the project. To emulate Android you can follow the above instructions and change 
the last command to `react-native run-android`
